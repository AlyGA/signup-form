# Sign-Up Form

This project is a signup form written purely in HTML and CSS. There were no libraries used. However, that may change in the future.

The design idea was taken from The Odin Project, however, all code was written completely from scratch by me.

The following table shows the progress status of the project.

## Step 1: Set up and planning

| Implementation                   |    Status     |

| Create color palette for website | Not Completed |
| Find font for website use        | Not Completed |
| Create dummy code for files      | Not Completed |

## Step 2: Design HTML/CSS files

This step will be added once step 1 has been completed
